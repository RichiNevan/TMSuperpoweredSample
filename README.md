The purpose of this repo changed slightly: i would like to get a simple module (the one provided here: https://reactnative.dev/docs/the-new-architecture/pure-cxx-modules) working on both android and iOS.
The repo follows the instruction written in the docs. Only the files' name change, and that is for me to understand the various naming conventions, as well as to give the files the name that they will have in the official project, that will use the Superpowered library.

The android version is working well. The iOS not quite yet.
